## Hi, Foreign! I'm Gorka ðŸ‘‹

Around 1987, an 8-bit MSX computer and the heyday of science fiction, video games and role-playing games dragged me into this programming dungeon that I'm still trying to free myself from.

After many campaigns as a freelancer, consultant, entrepreneur, team leader, engineering manager... today I survive as a staff engineer focused on developer experience, helping others navigate the maze.

If you want to get in touch, you can always summon me through [my website](https://gorka.io).

May the odds be with you!
