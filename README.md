### Hi! I'm Gorka ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer working remotely from the beautiful city of [Vitoria-Gasteiz](https://www.vitoria-gasteiz.org/we001/was/we001Action.do?idioma=en&accionWe001=ficha&accion=turismo).

I've worked for some startups like [Trovit](https://trovit.com) and [Ulabox](https://ulabox.com) in the past, as a developer and lead. I've also worked for [ThoughtWorks Spain](https://www.thoughtworks.com/locations/spain) as a [Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)](https://landing.google.com/sre/), engaged in the observability of a project with hundreds of microservices running on AWS. Nowadays I work as lead Elixir developer for [Tembeza International](https://www.tembeza.com/).

I've built things with Elixir, PHP, Java, Python, Go, Ruby, Javascript... and anything in between. I have a passion for Elixir, and I'm currently learning some Erlang. I'm also an organiser for the [Google Developer Group of Vitoria](https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/GDG-Vitoria/) and [give some talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E82TGUMaUqk) from time to time.

I believe sharing, teaching and mentoring others is the best way to give back to the community, so if you think I can help you with anything just get in touch with me and I'll do my best to help ðŸ˜Š

If you want to know a little more about me, head over to [my blog (in Spanish)](https://gorka.io) or [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/gorkaio).
